# Brew & Beans â€“ Coffee Shop Website

This is a complete, responsive coffee shop website built with Tailwind CSS. It includes four pages: Home (index.html), About (about.html), Menu (menu.html), and Contact (contact.html).

How to use:

1. Open index.html in a browser to view the home page.
2. Use the navigation links to explore About, Menu, and Contact pages.
3. The content uses placeholders like https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565986829539-cb936ef8805f?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw3fHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1OTkwMjY1OXww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 which should be replaced with real image URLs or assets in your deployment.

Notes:
- All styling relies on Tailwind CSS classes (no separate CSS files).
- Background color palette follows the Coffee Shop theme: primary color #3C2415, secondary #8B4513, accent #D2B48C, background #F5DEB3.
- Headings use category-appropriate fonts via font-[...] utility classes (handled by the hosting environment).

Files included:
- index.html: Home page with hero, highlights, story, testimonials, gallery, and footer.
- about.html: Our story and values.
- menu.html: Menu items with drinks and pastries.
- contact.html: Contact form and location details.
- README.md: This guide.
